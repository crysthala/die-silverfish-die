# die-silverfish-die
Kills silverfish the moment they spawn. Hopefully, performance impact should be minimal.

## Installation
Press the "Clone or Download" button on this page and select "Download ZIP". Open the .zip archive and extract the die-silverfish-die folder to the saves/world-name/datapacks folder. If you're currently running Minecraft, you'll need to enter the /reload command before it'll start working. You can confirm it's loaded by using /datapack list.

### But... Every Save????
Yes. There are mods that can automatically load datapacks for you, but on vanilla, the only way to load them is to manually add the data pack to individual saves. No, I don't know why Mojang did this.
